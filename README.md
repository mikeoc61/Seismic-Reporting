# Seismic-Reporting

Python3 program which queries earthquake historical data and outputs results
sorted by distance from a given coordinate defined in output.py.

Uses the Haversine formula to calculate distance relative starting coordinate.

earthquakes.py is the command line version

earthquakes_gui is the GUI version built with Tkinter

Both versions import the output.py which also imports haversine.py
